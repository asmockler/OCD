#### What people are saying

> Hi, ...I'm 16, and have severe OCD. When I found this app and tried it out, it gave me some sense of relief,
> showing that I'm not the only one who has this. I'm so happy I found this App because now I can finally
> show my peers, family, and friends a small glimpse of what OCD really is. I'm just writing today to just
> say thank you so much for creating this. It deserves so much more recognition than it has, and I just
> appreciate your app so much. So thank you!

## Generating screenshots

This project is equipped to auto-generate screenshots for releases. To create screenshots:

* Ensure you have [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot#readme) installed
  * Usually `gem install fastlane` will suffice
* Run `fastlane snapshot`

You can modify `Snapfile` as needed to suit new screenshot requirements.
