## Generating screenshots

This project is equipped to auto-generate screenshots for releases. To create screenshots:

* Ensure you have [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/snapshot#readme) installed
  * Usually `gem install fastlane` will suffice
* Run `fastlane snapshot`

You can modify `Snapfile` as needed to suit new screenshot requirements.
